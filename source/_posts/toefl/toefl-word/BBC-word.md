## Christian Eriksen scores goal for Denmark at Euro 2024, three years after suffering cardiac arrest at previous tournament

[visit](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/christian-eriksen-goal-denmark-euro-2024-cardiac-arrest-euro-2020-spt-intl/index.html)

- Eriksen **collapsed** on the **pitch** after suffering **cardiac arrest**
- brilliant finish
- lead against
- taking Jonas Wind’s clever **back-heel**^回传^ **on his chest**^胸部停球^ before **volleying**^凌空抽射^ into the bottom corner
- a huge grin plastered across his face — was in stark contrast to the distressing scenes at Euro 2020
- arm-in-arm
- trying to **shield**^防护^ him from the cameras and supporters in the **stands**^看台^
- There was relief around the stadium — and around the word — when a **conscious**^清醒的^ Eriksen **waved**^挥手^ to the crowd as he was being **stretchered off**^担架抬出去^ the pitch
- cardiac resuscitation
- After receiving life-saving treatment on the pitch, Eriksen was subsequently **fitted** with an Implantable Cardioverter **Defibrillator** (ICD) device — a type of **pacemaker** intended to prevent fatal cardiac arrests by discharging a **jolt** to restore regular **heart rhythm**

- build on Eriksen’s goal
- deflected shot
- England earned an **unconvincing**^难以置信的^ 1-0 win over Serbia thanks  to Jude Bellingham’s **first-half**^上半场^ **header** ^头球^
- Serbia **barely had a touch of the ball** inside the opening 10 minutes, struggling to get to the game as England passed the ball between themselves **with ease**
- England was similarly **dominant in possession** against Iceland in the final friendly before  the start of Euro 2024, but an insipid performance ended with the victory at Wembley
- But Gareth Southgate’s side was playing with an obvious **vigor** in the early stages against Serbia, **snapping into challenges** and passing the ball around with purpose.
- It wasn’t long before England took a deserved lead, as Bellingham timed his late run to perfection^完美的前插时机^ to get in front of his defender and head Bukayo Saka’s **deflected cross**^回传中^ past Predrag Rajkovic in the Serbia goal.
- gee up the England fans  
- put the ball out for a throw-in
- barge^驳船^  sb in the chest  用肩膀碰了sb的胸口
- Much to the Serbian winger’s annoyance 
- England was given a warning — if it needed one — of just how quickly the game can change when an error from Trent Alexander-Arnold gifted Aleksander Mitrovic possession, but the AI Hilal striker^前锋^ flashed his effort^shoot^ **a fraction wide of the post**^稍稍偏出边柱^
- That hairy moment aside
- An extremely assured first half from England
- made it 2-0
- through on goal
- cross the ball
- The second half, however, was **decidedly** less comfortable for England. Serbia began to **grow into** the game and had England **pinned back** into its own **penalty box** for long periods, but a lack of any quality in attack meant **clear cut chances** were **few and far between**.
- Harry Kane had the best chance of the second half but his **header** was brilliantly **tipped** onto the **crossbar** by Rajkovic, who celebrated his save **as though** he had own Euro 2024
- England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford had to be alert in the closing stages to **turn** Dusan Vlahovic **vicious** long-range **strike** over the **bar**, but that was the closest Serbia got to an **equalizer**.

  ## ‘Dyson spheres’ were theorized as a way to detect alien life. Scientists say they’ve found potential evidence
  
  [visit](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/dyson-spheres-alien-life-evidence-scn/index.html)
  
  - Freeman Dyson **theorized** that **hypothetical** alien **megastructures** would give off **infrared radiation** and search for that byproduct would be a viable method for searching for **extraterrestrial** life.
  - a shell made up of mirrors or solar panels that completely surrounds a star — harnessing all the energy it produces.
  - take hold
  - a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star.
  - a finding that’s attracting scrutiny and alternate theories.
  - set out
  - get rid of
  - astronomy
  - glow in the infrared
  - conclusive evidence
  - Among the natural causes that could explain the infrared glow are an unlucky alignment   in the observation, with a galaxy in the background overlapping with the star, planetary collisions creating debris, or the fact that the stars may be young and therefore still surrounded by disks of hot debris from which planets would later form.
  - red dwarfs
  - dimmer and smaller than our sun
  - orbiting planets
  - infrared anomalies
  - a postdoctoral research fellow
  - far beyond humanity’s grasp
  - we should dismantle Jupiter
  - contrary to the expectations of some that they might be an inevitable end-state of technological species’ expansion out into their solar system.
  - bear his name
  - Dyson showed that three competing quantum theories were actually the same theory —  he summarily ended the competition.
  - Later, he applied his genius to areas of astronomy, cosmology, the extraterrestrial realm, and also the very real problem of nuclear proliferation here on planet Earth.
  - a provocative and creative thinker
