## Christian Eriksen scores goal for Denmark at Euro 2024, three years after suffering cardiac arrest at previous tournament

[visit](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/christian-eriksen-goal-denmark-euro-2024-cardiac-arrest-euro-2020-spt-intl/index.html)

- Eriksen **collapsed** on the **pitch** after suffering **cardiac arrest**
- brilliant finish
- lead against
- taking Jonas Wind’s clever **back-heel**^回传^ **on his chest**^胸部停球^ before **volleying**^凌空抽射^ into the bottom corner
- a huge grin plastered across his face — was in stark contrast to the distressing scenes at Euro 2020
- arm-in-arm
- trying to **shield**^防护^ him from the cameras and supporters in the **stands**^看台^
- There was relief around the stadium — and around the word — when a **conscious**^清醒的^ Eriksen **waved**^挥手^ to the crowd as he was being **stretchered off**^担架抬出去^ the pitch
- cardiac resuscitation
- After receiving life-saving treatment on the pitch, Eriksen was subsequently **fitted** with an Implantable Cardioverter **Defibrillator** (ICD) device — a type of **pacemaker** intended to prevent fatal cardiac arrests by discharging a **jolt** to restore regular **heart rhythm**
- midfielder 
- contract    nv
- Eriksen’s brush with death has made the midfielder remarkable philosophical and reflective about life and living
- One of the first quotes I heard was that even you feel good, you’re going to feel bad, you’re going to feel good again. It’s just going to go up and down — time is your best friend.
- build on Eriksen’s goal
- deflected shot
- England earned an **unconvincing**^难以置信的^ 1-0 win over Serbia thanks  to Jude Bellingham’s **first-half**^上半场^ **header** ^头球^
- Serbia **barely had a touch of the ball** inside the opening 10 minutes, struggling to get to the game as England passed the ball between themselves **with ease**
- England was similarly **dominant in possession** against Iceland in the final friendly before  the start of Euro 2024, but an insipid performance ended with the victory at Wembley
- But Gareth Southgate’s side was playing with an obvious **vigor** in the early stages against Serbia, **snapping into challenges** and passing the ball around with purpose.
- It wasn’t long before England took a deserved lead, as Bellingham timed his late run to perfection^完美的前插时机^ to get in front of his defender and head Bukayo Saka’s **deflected cross**^回传中^ past Predrag Rajkovic in the Serbia goal.
- gee up the England fans  
- put the ball out for a throw-in
- barge^驳船^  sb in the chest  用肩膀碰了sb的胸口
- Much to the Serbian winger’s annoyance 
- England was given a warning — if it needed one — of just how quickly the game can change when an error from Trent Alexander-Arnold gifted Aleksander Mitrovic possession, but the AI Hilal striker^前锋^ flashed his effort^shoot^ **a fraction wide of the post**^稍稍偏出边柱^
- That hairy moment aside
- An extremely assured first half from England
- made it 2-0
- through on goal
- cross the ball
- The second half, however, was **decidedly** less comfortable for England. Serbia began to **grow into** the game and had England **pinned back** into its own **penalty box** for long periods, but a lack of any quality in attack meant **clear cut chances** were **few and far between**.
- Harry Kane had the best chance of the second half but his **header** was brilliantly **tipped** onto the **crossbar** by Rajkovic, who celebrated his save **as though** he had own Euro 2024
- England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford had to be alert in the closing stages to **turn** Dusan Vlahovic **vicious** long-range **strike** over the **bar**, but that was the closest Serbia got to an **equalizer**.
