## print

这两个都能打印出来，里面有双引号外面就用单引号

    print(" I'm excited but you 'not '.") 
    print('I "said" do not touch this.')

1. print('His name is', name , 'and his age is', age) 
2. print(f'His name is {name} and his age is {age}’)
3. print('His name is {} and his age is {}'.format(name, age))
4. print(f'His name is {name=} and his age is {age=}’)
5. print('His name is {0} and his age is {1}'.format(name, age))
6. print('His name is {1} and his age is {0}'.format(name, age))  # 位置交换了
7. print('His name is {name} and his age is {age}'.format(name=‘ahmed’, age=20))

## string

外面双引号还是单引号无所谓，记住里面要用转义符/就行（跟外面一样才用）

    Name1= ‘Python’ 
    Name2= "Python " 
    Name3= " it\’s Python " 
    Name4= " Yes \" it\'s Python \"" #这个的`it\'s`可以不用\
    Name41= " Yes \" it's Python \""
    Name5= ' Yes " it\'s Python " ' 
    Name6=' Yes " it's Python " ' #这个是错的



    types_of_people = 10 
    x = f"There are {types_of_people} types of people." binary = "binary" 
    do_not = "don't" 
    y = f"Those who know {binary} and those who {do_not}." 
    print(x) 
    print(y) 
    
    print(f"I said: {x}")  #=print("I said: ",x)
    print(f"I also said: '{y}'") 
    
    hilarious = False 
    joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! {}" print(joke_evaluation.format(hilarious)) 
    
    w = "This is the left side of..." 
    e = "a string with a right side." 
    print(w + e)

### long string

use 

    """
    """

### index of string

(     [ )      left first is 0 and right first is 1  )

- name[0]  #character in position 1
- name[-1]  #last character
- name='Python’
    -  name[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded) 
        - 'Py’ 
    - name[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded) 
        - 'tho’ 
    - name[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded) 
        -  'Py' 
    - name[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
        - 'on' 
    - name[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end 
        - 'on’

    - name[1:100] 
        - ython
    - name[-100:] 
        - Python 

python string cannot be changed

- name[0]='J'
    - TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
- name[2:]=‘JO’ 
    - TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignmen

different string can use +

- newname= 'J' +name[1:] 
    - Jython
-  newname2= name[:2]  + ' J ‘ + name[2:]
    -  PyJthon

### length of string

`len(name)` Space is counted

# 2

## variables

不能以数字开头,不能带除了underscore以外的special character, and no keyword

全大写的是symbolic constants, they never change

## input

`name = input("please enter :")`

## list

`list.append[9]`

`list=[ ‘c’ , ‘name’,  25, [10, 20,30] ]`

# 3， 4

太简单了懒得写了

## 5

### FUNCTION

#### arguments

1. position arguments
2. keyword arguments :     `sum(y=1, x=10)`
3. default arguments  :     `def sum(x, y=10):`



1. variable lenght arguments 

    def printing(*argu):
    for x in argu:
        print(x)
    ...
    ...
    printing(1,2,3,4,5)
    printing("as","sd","qe","eq")
